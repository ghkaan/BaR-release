# Batch Runner (BaR)
<!--img src="splash_list480.png" width="32"-->

### Overview
**Batch Runner (BaR)** is a tool designed to execute and validate sets of SAS, PY and R programs, BAT and CMD batch files. It provides functionality to:

- Load jobs, add programs to the list using Drag-n-Drop
- Run programs or batch files sequentially or in parallel
- Categorize programs or batch files for organized execution
- Analyzes program outputs (log\lst files, and optionally validation datasets for SAS programs)
- Edit programs in internal editor with syntax highlight
- Generate detailed reports with color coding and filters
- Manage program execution with skip/pause/reset options
- Get information about authors from git or svn if exist
- Access all functions in 3 ways: through menus, hotkeys and context menus
- File associations can be registered for .bar, .log or .lst files from File menu
- Command line parameter can be used to open .bar, .log or .lst files, for example:
```
> bar.exe "c:\Project1\ADB\adb.bar"
```
The application supports multiple languages, color themes, provides logging capabilities.

### Main menu
Provides access to all application functionality through several sections:

1. **File** menu - Job management (new, load, save, recent jobs), program management (add programs to the job or remove them), some settings
2. **Job** menu - Program execution, sorting, applying categoies, run type, encoding (for SAS)
3. **Reports** menu - Log analysis and reporting
4. **Help** menu - Information about program, help articles

Each menu section contains related commands for specific operations.

### Main window
The main window displays the list of programs divided into groups or categories. Each group will be launched separately during the run, and you can specify whether the programs in the group should be run sequentially or in parallel.
You can add or remove programs from the list, save the list of loaded programs (job), and open saved lists (jobs).
After loading a job and after launching the programs, several checks are performed: for example, the dates of the programs and logs are compared, and messages in the LOG files are verified.
Detected issues are displayed in the main window with color coding for better visibility.
You can select multiple records using LMB with Ctrl\Shift modifiers or by clicking on the category separator.

<img src="screenshots/bar_main3.png" width="400"> <img src="screenshots/bar_main2.png" width="400">

Columns:
1. Program index

### LOG messages
BaR scans LOG files for specific signatures and categorizes detected messages into five groups: PROHIBITED, RESTRICTED, CONDITIONAL, INFORMATIONAL, and CLEAN.

PROHIBITED – Critical errors and options that may suppress error messages; these must be corrected. Examples in SAS logs: records with "ERROR" or "FATAL", "NOTE: The SAS System stopped", "has not been compiled", "NOTE: Division by zero" and many more.
RESTRICTED – System warnings that may indicate potentially dangerous situations leading to data loss or corruption; these must be reviewed and corrected. If it is not possible to correct, should be checked and documented (for example, additional informational message in the log about the check). Examples in SAS logs: records with "WARNING", "NOTE: MERGE statement has more than one", "NOTE: Numeric values have been converted to character" and many more.
CONDITIONAL – Conditionally acceptable messages that may point to unexpected data or inaccurate data processing; these should be reviewed. Examples in SAS logs: "NOTE: The above message was for the following by", "NOTE: Invalid data for", "NOTE: No convergence of" and many more.
INFORMATIONAL – Informational messages. Examples in SAS logs: "already sorted", "ALERT_I", "ALERT_A" and other.
CLEAN – All other messages.

### License
Usage Modes:

Free Mode — permanently available, includes only the basic features:
- run — batch execution of SAS/R programs (sequential mode only);
- check — automated checking of LOG and LST files using rule sets;
- categories — ability to assign categories to programs for for organized execution.

Paid Mode — enables extended features:
parallel — batch execution of SAS/PY/R programs in both sequential and parallel modes;
categories — ability to assign categories to programs for more convenient display and for setting different run types (sequential\parallel) for each category.
report — generation and export of summary/detailed reports in XLSX format;
view — interactive viewing of LOG/LST files with color coding and message filtering.
edit — internal program editor with syntax highlight for SAS\R\PY programs and BAT\CMD files.

A license can be either time-limited (with an expiration date) or perpetual;

When a time-limited license expires, the application automatically reverts to free mode with basic functionality.
